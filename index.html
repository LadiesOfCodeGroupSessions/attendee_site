                            <b>How we work</b>
                            Every week, multiple teams come together and work on either katas or applications of their
                            own design.
                            <br/>
                            While doing this, every member works on the code at the same time.
                            <br/>
                            The role of the Driver (the person writing the code) is rotated through-out the session
                            while the rest of the team perform the Navigator role.
                            <br/>
                            We often have discussions before we start coding.
                            Some examples include:
                            Good coding and good testing practices,
                            Functional vs OO programming,
                            & different types of TDD.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b>Reasons to join</b>
                            You want to practice a new coding language with other women also learning that language.
                            <br/>You'd like to learn Test Driven Development/Design.
                            <br/>You want to dedicate time to katas.
                            <br/>You're keen to try ensemble coding (mobbing).
                            <br/>You want to meet more women developers.
                            <br/>You want to gain experience working in a team (good for self-learners).
                            <br/>You enjoy talking about coding with other people.

                            <b>How often do I need to attend?</b>
                            We suggest aiming for a ratio of 40 out of 52 weeks.
                            <br/>Having consistent attendance helps the
                            team but life happens.
                            <br/>We understand that you'll need to do other things on Wednesdays.
                            <br/>Also, we recommend that if you have taken leave from work then you should take leave from the
                            group too and enjoy your break.

                            <b>I know nothing about TDD or Ensemble coding, can I still join? </b>
                            Definitely! We'll start right at the beginning.

                            <b>What do I need to know before attending?</b>
                            You'll need to know the basics of at least of one programming language before attending -
                            that's it!
                            The basics include: Setting up a project, basic syntax, variables, primitive types, loops
                            and functions

                            I'm so thankful for the weekly sessions. I took up Python during the pandemic to learn a new
                            skill and hopefully transition career. <br/>
                            Self-learning is always tough but even more so under lockdown. <br/>
                            The Zoom sessions are great way to learn from each other, network and support each other as
                            we all have stories to share. <br/>
                            As the tech industry is so male-dominated it may be an intimidating prospect for a female
                            newbie to enter on their own. <br/>
                            I was particularly drawn to LoC because it's much easier to survive the jungle if you have a
                            tribe who can relate to you. <br/>
                            I've been overwhelmed by the kindness and support LoC offers, they give up considerable time
                            and energy to help us on our journeys.<br/>
