                            <b>How we work</b>
                            Every week, multiple teams come together and work on either katas or applications of their
                            own design.
                            <br/>
                            While doing this, every member works on the code at the same time.
                            <br/>
                            The role of the Typist (the person writing the code) is rotated throughout the session
                            while the rest of the team perform the Navigator role.
                            <br/>
                            We often have discussions before we start coding.
                            Some examples include:
                            Good coding and good testing practices,
                            Functional vs OO programming,
                            & different types of TDD.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b>Reasons to join</b>
                            You want to practice a new coding language with other women also learning that language.
                            <br/>You'd like to learn Test Driven Development/Design.
                            <br/>You want to dedicate time to katas.
                            <br/>You're keen to try ensemble coding (mobbing).
                            <br/>You want to meet more women developers.
                            <br/>You want to gain experience working in a team (good for self-learners).
                            <br/>You enjoy talking about coding with other people.

                            <b>How often do I need to attend?</b>
                            We suggest aiming for a ratio of 40 out of 52 weeks.
                            <br/>Having consistent attendance helps the
                            team but life happens.
                            <br/>We understand that you'll need to do other things on Wednesdays.
                            <br/>Also, we recommend that if you have taken leave from work then you should take leave from the
                            group too and enjoy your break.

                            Definitely! We'll start right at the beginning.

                            You'll need to know the basics of at least of one programming language before attending -
                            that's it!
                            The basics include: Setting up a project, basic syntax, variables, primitive types, loops
                            and functions

                            I'm so thankful for the weekly sessions. I took up Python during the pandemic to learn a new
                            skill and hopefully transition career. <br/>
                            Self-learning is always tough but even more so under lockdown. <br/>
                            The Zoom sessions are great way to learn from each other, network and support each other as
                            we all have stories to share. <br/>
                            As the tech industry is so male-dominated it may be an intimidating prospect for a female
                            newbie to enter on their own. <br/>
                            I was particularly drawn to LoC because it's much easier to survive the jungle if you have a
                            tribe who can relate to you. <br/>
                            I've been overwhelmed by the kindness and support LoC offers, they give up considerable time
                            and energy to help us on our journeys.<br/>

                        <div class="u-container-layout u-valign-middle u-container-layout-1">
                            I’ve joined the group sessions since the beginning of 2021.
                            I’ve been learning about Ensemble/Mob programming and Test-driven development (TDD).
                            I was not used to writing tests before feature code, and I feel it’s a very interesting way
                            of working,
                            that puts me in a different problem-solving space.
                            I do at times incorporate a little bit of TDD into my day-to-day work.
                            <br/>

                            In almost every session, I learn a new functionality in python language,
                            from practicing Katas (also a first for me).
                            I also learn from sessions dedicated to discussing specific topics, such as Dependency
                            Injection,
                            different programming paradigms, and TDD. These often include quizzes.
                            It’s also great to get to know people from different backgrounds all coming together to
                            learn
                            and upskill themselves.
                            <br/>

                            This is an amazing initiative, with a super friendly and welcoming environment,
                            that I recommend especially for newcomers to the industry!
